Mr. Scott gave me an extension on this project because my computer died the week leading up to the due date and I had to send it off to Apple to be fixed.  It died on Friday (5/1) and I got it back a week later on (5/8).  I emailed the professor that day but he never responded with a definitive end to my extension, so I worked to get it done as soon as possible.  I figured at the very least I should turn it in within a week of the original due date, because that’s how long I was without my computer, so that’s why I did.  Hopefully that is acceptable.

For the project itself, I’m sorry that the tables display in the wrong order and not near the text they are associated with.  I tried everything I found on the internet to make the figures stay in place, I even wrote my own LatTex header file and nothing worked.  

All in all
thanks for a great semester,

Dylan Deshler
